#### About Me 👨🏾‍💻
I'm Macheza Dzabala, but everyone calls me Cheza.

I'm a Malawian software Engineer currently based out of Kigali Rwanda. 

I'm a full stack engineer with practical experience in JavaScript, Php, C# & Dart. 

Just started my Python Journey.

#### Frameworks 🖼

These are my all time favorite frameworks:

- Node / Express
- NestJS
- NextJS
- React
- Flutter
- Laravel


#### Stacks 📱
Though I haven't used this strack in a while, my favorite stack by far is the MERN stack. 

I've also worked with the Google Cloud Platform & Flutter for my mobile needs.

#### Thoughts 💬
Where as Flutter may be my mobile framework of choice, I feel Flutter for Web still has some ways to go before the developer experience is truly as good as the mobile dev experience.
